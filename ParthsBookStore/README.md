Created Project at SCC in Winter 2023.

ParthsBookStore Project.

The MVC design pattern is used in this application. 
it also uses Entity Framework Core to execute CRUD operations. 
The customer should be able to purchase books online and receive 
discounts after this application is finished. 
The user will have the option to place orders later. 
Moreover, I also want to add other features.
